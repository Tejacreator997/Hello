EBS :Elastic Block Storage.
Instance Storage area is Volumes
AMI Storage area is Snapshots
SSD is Solid State Drive.
HDD Hard Disk Drive.
RUN <devmgmt.msc>
RUN<diskmgmt.msc>

The AMI will be stored on the snapshot, so the snapshot will be chargeable.
Snapchat will you get chargeable so during the practice only you can do that.
The snapshot you can please delete today.
That means, do not use the AMI.
I will tell based on the scenario during the time only you need to create the instance into AMI and do the task.
After that you please keep the VM and email you.
Please delete it.
Suppose, suppose I'll tell you the rough calculation.
I'm poor in mathematics.
OK, So what?



This concept is Windows operating system is a different level and
 Linux operating system is different level
We need to do it so now in this video I'm explaining EPS concept in Windows.
In the next class tomorrow 
I will explain how to manage the EBS volume in the Linux operating system.
I'll show you.
OK, two videos now.About 
this 5 GB volume, you can create as a new drive like a D drive E drive.
You can create it either you can expand the C drive 30 GB to 35 GB is possible, extend volume.

That is a concept called extend volume
So now it's a 35G.

We can go and check here.
But afresh now is the 29.9.
Now it's a 34.9.

This is the way we can increase the existing drive


Suppose I need a separate volume.
I need a separated drive with a separate volume.
Is this possible?
Yes, in this case go to volumes.
Create a volume and what is the purpose you are creating?
You can select the what is the volume type on route.
Now I'm selecting the SSD GP3 and the size how much unit I'm just giving 5 GB 
and you guys.
So for demo purpose I'm creating minimum one GP maximum 16,384 and the 
instance is running in which availability zone example.
It is available on the AP S 2B.
You need to create on 2B only if you creating in two a it will not communicate.
This is the condition if you creating the volume additional volume for 
the instance you need to check the before creating the volume 
the instance is running on the which availability zone 
in the same availability zone.
You need to create the volume and created.

Now the five GB is creating.
Want this?
Fighting is created by default.
It is available.
That means no one is using, no one is using.
So what we need to do, we need to attach 
this volume to instance that is called attach.
